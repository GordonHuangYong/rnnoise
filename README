RNNoise is a noise suppression library based on a recurrent neural network

To compile, just type:
% ./autogen.sh
% ./configure
% make

Optionally:
% make install

Or 

use CMake.

While it is meant to be used as a library, a simple command-line tool is
provided as an example. It operates on wav mono files. It can be used as:

./examples/rnnoise_demo input.wav

the output filename is "input_out.wav"
